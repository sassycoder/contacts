# Web Developer Test

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Compose 1.8.1][docker-compose]

## Getting Started

Once you have Docker Compose installed navigate to the root of this project's directory and run the following command.

```shell
docker-compose up
```

After the required container images are downloaded and built you should see three services start and begin logging their output.

### Services

#### App
A simple [AngularJS][angular-docs] web application written in [ES2015][es2015], transpiled through [Babel][babel] and served through using [Webpack][webpack] and [Webpack Dev Server][webpack-dev-server] at http://localhost:8080 by default (can be overridden through environment variables in `.env`).

As changes are made to the source files in `./app/src` the application should automatically compile and reload in browser to reflect your changes.

#### API
A simple Node.js RESTful API that makes use of the [Restify][restify] framework and the [MongoDB Node.js Driver][mongodb-nodejs-driver].

The API is accessible via `webpack-dev-server` hosting the App through the `/api/` path (http://localhost:8080/api/).

As changes are made to the source files in `./api/src` the API should automatically restart to reflect your changes.

#### Database (DB)
A MongoDB instance with its data written to the mounted path `./db/data` so it persists between runs.

## The Test

Please spend no longer than 2 hours on this test it is fine if you do not complete all the tasks they are just to provide a basis for discussion if you are invited for a face-to-face interview.

If you have any questions before beginning this test please feel free to contact me via [jonathan.mosley@salmon.com](mailto:jonathan.mosley@salmon.com)

### Tasks
